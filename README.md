### 2) Objective
Analyze sales data from 24 stores across 3 countries and 10 states over 24 months to uncover growth trends, customer behavior, and product performance, enabling managers and analysts to drive data-driven business strategies.

### 3) Tech Stack
The following tools & technologies played key role in building this project:
  - üü© **MS Excel:** For storing the extracted raw data tables (csv format).
  - üõ¢Ô∏è **My SQL Workbench:** Data transformation & cleaning for preparing data for further analysis.
  - üìä **Power BI Desktop:** Main data visualization platform, used for report creation.
  - üîó **Data Modeling:** For relationship establishment among the tables to enable cross-filtering & aggregations.
  - üß† **DAX (Data Analysis Expression):** For calculated measures, dynamic visuals & conditional logics.

### 4) Data Source
**Source:** https://github.com/ 
- Data on 24 **Maven Market** stores spanning across 3 countries, 10 states over a 24-month period covering over 10,000 unique customers with 1,000 unique products. It captures details on sales, customer demographics, product information, store & regional attributes.

### 5) Business problem
Maven Market operates across multiple countries, states, and stores with a vast product portfolio and diverse customer base. However, the business lacks a centralized analytical view to track sales growth, customer retention, store performance, and regional trends. Without such insights, it becomes difficult to identify top-performing areas, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer engagement for sustainable growth.

Additionally, the absence of detailed performance tracking limits the ability to measure the impact of store remodeling and service strategies. This makes it challenging for management to make data-driven decisions and maintain a competitive edge in the retail industry.
